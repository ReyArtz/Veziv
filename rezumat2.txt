* Front-end: Not specified, but likely to be a web-based application built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js).
* Back-end: A robust and scalable server-side technology (e.g., Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails) to handle business logic, data storage, and API integrations.
* Database: A relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server) to store and manage data.
* APIs: Integration with WinMENTOR software and potentially an API bancar for automating financial transactions.

4. Cash Flow Management:
	* Implement a system for tracking company expenses and income, including automatic import of CSV files from bank statements.
	* Develop a budgeting system for managing monthly expenses and sending notifications when limits are reached.
5. Integration with WinMENTOR:
	* Integrate the new system with the existing WinMENTOR software to ensure a seamless transition of data and processes.

**Additional Tasks:**
